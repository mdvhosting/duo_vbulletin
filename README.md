Duo Security two-factor authentication for vBulletin

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vBulletin is a popular online community software used by many websites. While 
vBulletin is a fairly secure platform, it still suffers from a very common 
vulnerability: it relies on usernames and passwords. For many online 
communities, security is becoming a greater concern as new web-based threats 
continue to emerge. A single compromised administrative account can result in 
an entire community being destroyed. Thatâ€™s where Duo Security comes in and 
provides an extra layer of security to the vBulletin platform.
